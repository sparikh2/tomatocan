### QUIZ FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPERS
To determine current skill level -

Refer to http://github.com/ece106/tomatocan and use tutorials, Google, etc. to help you figure out the answers. 

1. Copy schema.rb and save it as schema.txt. Describe each field of the events, merchandises, purchases, rsvpqs, and users tables.
e.g. "created_at" - Time and date at which each record was created
"twitter" - user's twitter handle

2. Which file/view is the users' profile page? What information can users display on their page? 

3. Where is the users' profile page information stored in the Tomatocan database?

4. What files does Rails autogenerate when you generate scaffolding for a table? 

5. User pages are found by their permalink rather than record id number. What are the routes that were added to the Tomatocan app so the views for user pages could be displayed?

6. What are the methods that were added to the Tomatocan app so the user views could be displayed? 

7. What gem is used for signin/signout? How many times is it mentioned in the Tomatocan repository?

### TO USE THE CODE IN YOUR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENT

0. To set up Ruby on Rails on Mac or Linux, go to
https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.13-high-sierra
Make sure you install the Postresql database, not sqlite. No need to create the myapp example since you'll be using the CrowdPublish.TV code.

1. Fork tomatocan to your local machine

Fork the tomatocan code by clicking the fork button at http://github.com/ece106/tomatocan. Forking will allow you to have a copy of the tomatocan code in your personal github. 

Clone the fork you have created. 

a. On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the tomatocan repository.

b. Under the repository name, click ``` Clone or download ```. Do NOT download.

c. To CLONE the repository: In a terminal, in the directory you would like to store your code:

```
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME/tomatocan
```

2. Files To Check/Change/Create: 

* gemfile: 

If you're using sqlite3:
    Comment out 
```
    #gem 'pg' 
```
and uncomment 
```
gem 'sqlite3'

```
If you're using postgresql, leave the gemfile as is.

* config/initializers/aakeys.rb: 
    Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY = 'fake'
AWS_KEY = 'morefake'
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'pretend' 
AWS_BUCKET = 'yourawsbucketname'
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "madeup"
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "allfake"
GMAIL_PWD = "superfake"
Stripe.api_key = STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID = "superfake"
```

Of course, with the fake keys, you will not be able to use AWS (upload files to user profiles), Devise (logins), or Stripe (purchase items from authors). If you have your own AWS, Devise, or Stripe accounts, you may replace the keys in config/initializers/aakeys.rb with your accounts' keys. 

*config/database.yml

Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

For postgresql:

```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  encoding: unicode
  database: YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_DATABASE_NAME
  username: YOUR_USERNAME

test:
  <<: *default
  encoding: unicode
  database: YOUR_TEST_DATABASE_NAME
  username: YOUR_USERNAME

production:
  <<: *default
```

For sqlite3:

```
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3

test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3
```

DO NOT NAME YOUR DEVELOPMENT DATABASE THE SAME AS YOUR TEST DATABASE!!!

* config/environments/development.rb: 

Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
Rails.application.configure do

config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
  :port => 587,
  :user_name => "randomemail@gmail.com",
  :password => 'fake',
  :authentication => 'plain',
  :enable_starttls_auto => true
}
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {
  host: "localhost:3000", protocol: "http" 
}
  config.cache_classes = false
  config.eager_load = false
  config.consider_all_requests_local = true

  if Rails.root.join('tmp/caching-dev.txt').exist?
    config.action_controller.perform_caching = true

    config.cache_store = :memory_store
    config.public_file_server.headers = {
      'Cache-Control' => "public, max-age=#{2.days.seconds.to_i}"
    }
  else
    config.action_controller.perform_caching = false
    config.cache_store = :null_store
  end

  config.active_support.deprecation = :log
  config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load
  config.assets.debug = true
  config.assets.quiet = true
  config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker
end
```

3. Then type
```
>gem install bundler
```
at the command line so you can install all the gems.

Then type
```
>bundle install
```
at the command line to install all the necessary gems.

4. Then type
```
>rake db:migrate
```
at the command line to build the database with the correct schema.

Then type
```
>rails s
```
at the command line from the tomatocan directory to start the server.
